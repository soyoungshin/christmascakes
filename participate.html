Are you looking for connection? Artists Soyoung Shin and Anthony Bodlović are coming to Seattle and are ready to mingle!
		</div>
		<div>

We are looking for individuals who would like to participate in their upcoming experiment in dating, "Christmas Cakes in April." The one-time-only event loosely follows a reality show format where contestants will participate in activities with either Soyoung or Anthony. The winners will receive a complimentary dinner at one of their favorite restaurants in Seattle.

		</div>
		<div>
Even if you are simply looking for friendship, want to try something new, or are very much coupled up and need a coffee buddy, we encourage you to apply! All interactions and participations are valid!
		</div>
		<div>
The event is for Yellow Fish // Epic Durational Performance Festival XVII, and will be held on April 8, from 1-4 pm, live at the Factory gallery. The event will be recorded in front of a live studio audience.

			I like making lists, staying up late talking, sleeping in, ghost stories, being in water, and having adventures. I’m looking to make a genuine connection with anyone who is interested - men, women, queer, straight -  whether this connection last a lifetime or just for a moment.

	I love making clothing, spending time in the outdoors, and eating delicious food. I’ve been known to spend an entire day cooking a single meal. I have a big heart, and want it to be open once again, but only for that special someone. Specifically though, I’m dreaming of someone who has a sense of humor, likes giving massages, and can lift 150 pounds. I really let my freak flag fly, so if you’re down for adventure, call me!
